            <h3>
                500 Words + Video

                As part of your report you are required to include a video showing the artefact in operation. The
                video must not be more than 5 minutes in duration and be no more than 1GB in size.
                The video should be used to demonstrate how your artefact meets the basic and/or advanced
                requirements of the brief. It is suggested that you deal with each requirement you attempted in
                the video and demonstrate how you have achieved it.
                You may wish to include a brief written description with images demonstrating how your artefact
                meets each of the requirements. You will not be penalised marks for not including any text if your
                video is sufficient in describing how you meet each of the requirements.

                In this section of the report you should show evidence of your own research on the thematic brief,
                including research on existing solutions, systems or ideas that are aligned to the brief. As a starting
                point you may consider using the URLs provided earlier in this document, but please note that this
                list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive. All references should be included in the reference section
                of your report.
                Based on your research you should provide a detailed description of your chosen project. You
                should explain clearly the objectives of your project.

            <p>
                I've always wanted to create a chess game, I thought it would serve as an inticing learning experience. 
                For this project I planned to use the PyGame to create a GUI chess game rather than a CLI based game. 
                Considering chess relies on patterns that are easier to see on a physical board, it made more sense 
                to render the game graphically. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Chess is a game that has been studied for centuries. Many developments and iterations have been made 
                to the game to create the current rendition that is played today. Ancient versions of the game didn't 
                even have check or checkmate (you did not need to notice your opponent if their king was under attack)
                this mean't the king could be taken like any other piece on the board, except taking the king ended the 
                game
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> has a wide range of 
                <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess"> documentation</a> on how chess is meant to be played. 
                Including how all the pieces move, how the board is set up, checkmate conditions, stalemate conditions 
                and more. For my version of chess I will foregore checkmate and base my version of the game on ancient 
                chess. This is because of the complexity of the algorithm. Considering the time allowed and how much 
                work is need to get the rest of the game functioning, it would be too tedious to implement this function 
                properly and test it to ensure it has no issues.  For that reason, we will allow the king to be taken 
                like a normal piece in ancient chess, check does not have to be called
            </p>

                You should include a detailed flowchart which gives an overview of how your system will work.
                You should explain how modelling and abstraction will be applied to your project.

                This section should provide a clear description of how the system was implemented. You should
                explain the process you went through in creating your artefact.
                You should explain one of the problems that you encountered during the implementation and
                describe how you overcame the problem.
                You should select and explain an algorithm or section of code you designed that was essential in
                creating your project.

                during the testing process. Details of testing should include the type of testing carried out and any
                implications to the design as a result of the testing.
                You should include a test table to highlight your test cases, expected results, outcomes and test
                data that were used.
