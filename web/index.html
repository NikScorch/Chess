        <h3>
            500 Words + Video

            As part of your report you are required to include a video showing the artefact in operation. The
            video must not be more than 5 minutes in duration and be no more than 1GB in size.
            The video should be used to demonstrate how your artefact meets the basic and/or advanced
            requirements of the brief. It is suggested that you deal with each requirement you attempted in
            the video and demonstrate how you have achieved it.
            You may wish to include a brief written description with images demonstrating how your artefact
            meets each of the requirements. You will not be penalised marks for not including any text if your
            video is sufficient in describing how you meet each of the requirements.
