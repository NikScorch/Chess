    flow charts of code/architechture
    test table
    shows the thing works 👍
    video
    list objectives
    then reflect on them (did you achieve them?)
    explain how you obstracted the problem
    explain the project in an abstract form (dont be nerdy)
    modelling (design) -- now be a nerd -- bring in the maths/code screenshots, the special bits
    (design) -- how will it be developed??
    (video?) - have a checklist that you can show what you got done and what didnt get done


    * brief:
                        mention the stats, (max, min, mode, mean, etc all basic mathsy o
                        functoins.)
                        "in addtion to the heat map {}" explain other stats, also what th 
                        is the heat map?? show the function
                        have a heading about advanded requirements:
                            - screenshot of analysis functions
                            - explain in english what it does (core concpet)
                            - screenshot of an output
    * investagtion and plan: 
                        talk about inspriation >> other graphical games or OOP projects. experience with  
                        these titles/systems
                        talk about astraction, decomposition (breaking down a large task into a set of smaller tasks) (ie. the check_position function in detail), modelling (how did you implement a chess piece?)
    * design: 
                        sys architechture diagram:
                            * inputs
                            * main processses
                            * where data is stored
                                - where that gets piped to be analysised
                                - what output does that produce - images/heatmaps
                            * where output goes
                        talk about absolutely required fuinctionality, ie the classes, the board, how it was rendered, 
                        what do you want each pioece to do (you do not have to be nitty gritty ie the maths behind the movement (do that in the implementation)).
                        approach to single player vs multiplayer, what needs to be changed for each
                        do you need functions to save all this data as the game plays (CURRENT BOARD LAYOUT)
                        how is all the current data/status of the pieces stored IN MEMORY
                        decompostion, abstraction and modelling, talk about check_position
    * implementation: 
                        OOP, another function in detail, explain a problem
                        basically the diary of the project, defo reference your git logs
                        i was working on this and finally got it working and then a example
                        why did you store the position in the ChessPiece object rather than a global 2d array 
                        with all positonal data of the pieces that they reference after the fact
    * evaluation: 
                        did your design style OOP work? are there function s taht could be optimised under another 
                        approach. when you abstraced the project was there another solution, is it clunky? can it 
                        be neater? (be technical), maybe add a gui? would it have been practical to add for the 
                        scope of this course and the time frame? 
                        talk about why you have avoided checkmate? what was your original idea? why did it fail?
                        talk about why you did a random move set rather than an ai
                        could reference stockfish or other implementations
                        functionality to move pieces by an external program is there but it is not intelligent

                    Welcome to my leaving cert computer science project for 2023.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    This project models chess in python. <br>
                    I am using the external library <a href="https://www.pygame.org">PyGame</a> to provide a graphical interface. <br>
                    I am basing this game on the Sanskrit version of chess (from 500-700 AD) which did not have a check or checkmate system. 
                    The king could be taken like a normal piece and this would end the game.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    There are a few core features I want to complete:
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>A turn system</li>
                        <li>Enforce correct movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>Pawn promotion to Queen</li>
                        <li>Automatic movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>Game save states</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since chess is a complex game with many different pieces, I needed my project architecture
                    to be flexible enough to process this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to go for an object-oriented approach to my design. Creating two major classes 
                    in which everything works off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Board" and "ChessPiece" classes effectively hold all of the game's code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A "ChessPiece" object has a colour value, piece type value, position value and a couple 
                    of status values for taking pieces. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the "Board" class houses multiple "ChessPiece" objects. It handles setting up the 
                    board, deciding whose turn it is, logging move data for analysis, saving the game and loading 
                    the game. It can also move a piece for a player automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By splitting the code into these two sections, we can process a variety of pieces on the 
                    board with relative ease.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The game can process both keyboard input, mouse input and touch input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been designed to accept a mouse click anywhere within the window. The program is intelligent 
                    enough to be able to reject an input if it is invalid (e.g. the user has not clicked on the ChessPiece, 
                    rather they clicked on empty space)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same is true for keyboard input. The keyboard is not required to play the game, but it 
                    adds additional functionality that the user can take advantage of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, saving the game, loading up a previous session, resetting the board and 
                    enabling single-player mode. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing the code for mouse input, I loaded the game onto a computer which has a touch screen. 
                    After a few adjustments to my code, the game is now fully playable on touch devices. Granted some 
                    functionality is lost on touch-only devices as some functions are bound to the keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game can compile the current state of the board into a save file. This file details the current 
                    position of all the pieces on the board, which pieces have been taken, whose turn it is and a log history 
                    of every move made so far. The logs include who moved what piece, where they moved it and how long it took 
                    them to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can analyse these save files to extract data such as the most (max) and least (min) commonly visited 
                    squares and the average (mean) time taken per move. We can use this to create a heat map of the most frequently
                    visited squares on the board.
                </p>
            </div>

                    I've always wanted to create a chess game. I thought it would serve as an enticing learning experience. 
                    Additionally, I've played a lot of chess recently with my friends so I've become quite familar with it. 
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    Chess has been a game that has been studied for centuries. Many developments and iterations have been 
                    made to the game over time to create the current rendition of the game played today. Some ancient 
                    versions of the game didn't have a check or checkmate system. The King could be taken like a normal piece, 
                    this would end the game, e.g. Sanskrit chess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I wanted to approach the problem with an object-oriented design. Since many of 
                    the pieces would share similar code with minor differences between them, it made sense to go with 
                    this architectural style. I have previous experience with the OOP style. For this project, I based a lot 
                    of my project on <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a>'s current functionality. I wanted to 
                    emulate most of their core features. Luckily, <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a> has great 
                    <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess">documentation</a> on the game, detailing all 
                    the rules of the game in depth.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    There are a few core components I want to complete:
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>A turn system</li>
                        <li>Enforce correct movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>Pawn promotion to a Queen</li>
                        <li>Automatic movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>Game save states</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program would be comprised of two dominant classes, one for chess pieces and another for the 
                    chessboard and turn handling. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To model the "ChessPiece" class, it will need attributes for its colour, piece type, where it is on 
                    the board, if it has been taken or not, if it is ready to take another piece, what board it is asscociated 
                    with and if it is currently attached to the mouse. Additionally, it needs methods to promote from a pawn 
                    to a queen, remove itself off the board and check if a piece can move to a given position. These three 
                    methods will be called in a loop in the model's "update" function, which will check for all of the

                    The "ChessPiece" class should hold a function to check if an object can move to a designated position 
                    on the board. It needs to work for different piece types. Firstly, it needs to avoid the new position 
                    if it holds one of the player's pieces. Secondly, it needs to calculate if there is a piece blocking its path. 
                    Thirdly, it needs to respect the movement restrictions of that piece. The third 
                    part will use a switch/match statement with a case for each piece type (Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queens, 
                    Pawns and Kings), this is detailed thoroughly in this <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-pieces">article</a>.

                    I've always wanted to create a chess game, I thought it would serve as an inticing learning experience. 
                    For this project I planned to use the PyGame to create a GUI chess game rather than a CLI based game. 
                    Considering chess relies on patterns that are easier to see on a physical board, it made more sense 
                    to render the game graphically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chess is a game that has been studied for centuries. Many developments and iterations have been made 
                    to the game to create the current rendition that is played today. Ancient versions of the game didn't 
                    even have check or checkmate (you did not need to notice your opponent if their king was under attack)
                    this mean't the king could be taken like any other piece on the board, except taking the king ended the 
                    game
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> has a wide range of 
                    <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess"> documentation</a> on how chess is meant to be played. 
                    Including how all the pieces move, how the board is set up, checkmate conditions, stalemate conditions 
                    and more. For my version of chess I will foregore checkmate and base my version of the game on ancient 
                    chess. This is because of the complexity of the algorithm. Considering the time allowed and how much 
                    work is need to get the rest of the game functioning, it would be too tedious to implement this function 
                    properly and test it to ensure it has no issues.  For that reason, we will allow the king to be taken 
                    like a normal piece in ancient chess, check does not have to be called.

                    This section of the report should contain a clear description of the design of your project and how
                    it will meet your objectives.
                    You should include a detailed flowchart which gives an overview of how your system will work.
                    You should explain how modelling and abstraction will be applied to your project.

                <p>
                    When it comes to the architectural design of my project, I'll be approaching the task with an object-oriented design.
                    I've worked with OOP projects in the past. This gives me a lot of flexibility when the game is running and when data is saved
                    as it will be in a consistent format that will reflect the programming style. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a top-down level of the project, the core game will have user input (from either a keyboard, mouse or touchscreen),
                    the main game/process, output to the screen and a save file database. Additionally, I will need a way to process data from 
                    other chess games into a common format, this will output into the save file database. Finally, I want a processor to take
                    the save file database and run an analysis on it, preferably outputting a frequency heat map as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is illustrated below
                </p>
                <img src="diagrams/sysarch.svg" alt="System Architecture Diagram" style="width: 100%;">
                <p>
                    Now onto the main game logic. We will need an event loop to process user data and update the board regularly.
                    We will have a chess piece class with coordinate, colour and shape attributes. Then we will have a board class with two 
                    chesspiece arrays and attributes for whose turn it is, who has won and how many moves have been taken and logs for every move. 
                    The position of each piece on the board is held inside each individual chess piece object. Each object knows where itself is, but not
                    any of the other pieces. It has to call on its parent board to retrieve a list of all the other pieces. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    User input will be processed in the main function and both keyboard and mouse input will be processed immediately so the effects
                    are shown on the screen at the end of the game tick (loop iteration). This must handle picking up pieces with the mouse, switching 
                    game modes and saving/loading game files. Then call the "update" method on every chess piece and we render the board thereafter. 
                    The "update" function will check if the piece has been picked up, if its new position is valid and if it should capture another 
                    piece. The board class will have a "draw" function to easily render the checkerboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The diagram below illustrates all this logic working together

                    As I've become more proficient with programming, I've began to appreciate the object oriented design principles more and more. Although I dont agree with everything about the design language, I feel an OOP approach to this project would be best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will design the program to follow Python3's module structure, this way it can easily packaged later on for distribution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program will have two dominant classes, a ChessPiece class and a Board class. As mentioned ealier, ChessPiece will handle data on what type of piece an object is, who owns it and where it is. Similary, the Board class will handle whose turn it is, logging move data, and saving and loading games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this design, the main function of the program can be much simplier and easier to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general control flow of the program is illustrated below
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since most of the complex processing is handled by ChessPiece and Board, the general logic of the program can be followed relatively easily.

                    Git was used during the entire development of the project. This lets me keep track of progress and 
                    roll back the project to a previous state should something go catastrophically wrong. The project 
                    can be found <a href="https://github.com/NikScorch/Chess">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knew that I wanted to design in an OOP style. In the main program, there are no global variables. Everything must
                    be passed from one function or another. With this in mind, we structure our code so that a board object contains
                    many chess piece objects. Every chess piece takes the parent board as a parameter, this way each chess piece
                    has access to the data of every other chess piece. The same is done for the GUI window, the board class takes
                    the screen as parameter "ctx". With this system, every object has access to every other object in a consistent
                    structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally I planned to store all chess piece objects in a 2d array with their position in the array representing
                    their position on the board. This created problems when rendering the pieces and checking where pieces could move to.
                    The code would've needed to loop over the 2d array many times to retrieve coordinate data. This proved to be a clunky
                    solution that I was not comfortable working with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the largest problems I had to solve regarded the "check_position" function. This compares where a piece is to 
                    where it wants to go and returns whether or not a piece can go there. It has a few general rules that apply to all
                    pieces, but it then switches its logic to be specific to the piece type, e.g. Knight, Bishop, etc. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Some pieces were relatively simple to implement. The Rook component checks if only one axis has changed, the Bishop
                    component checks if the slope between the new position and previous position has an absolute value of 1, the Queen 
                    combines both of these checks and the Knight can only move in a radius of 2.2 squares away from its starting position 
                    (this was calculated using the Pythagorean theorem). Pawns have their own set of rules, this includes when they are allowed
                    to move two squares, when they can take a piece, what direction they move when taking a piece and what direction they can
                    move based on their colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the most tedious piece to implement was the King. Ordinarily, the King moves in a radius of 1.4 or 1.0 squares.
                    The only exception to this is if the king wants to castle. Under these circumstances, the game must figure out 
                    which Rook the King is castling with, whether that specific King and Rook pair have a clear path between them and neither
                    piece has moved yet. If any one of these checks fails, then the King will not castle. This required adding a new
                    "moved" attribute to pieces to denote if they have moved yet. Additionally, this had to be represented appropriately in
                    the game save file, this was done by adding a 0 tick move on the Rook, impossibly fast for a human, so therefore it must've
                    castled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since my game handles keyboard and mouse input, it needs to be able to process a wide range of values from these sources.
                    Notably, it needs to reject any inputs from unmapped keys, and it must be able to recover if the user clicks outside the
                    window or on an empty space. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user clicks on the screen, it tries to find which piece the mouse is closest to. It does this by drawing a line
                    from the mouse to the centre of every piece on the board. Afterwards, it selects the piece with the shortest distance to 
                    the mouse and notifies the rest of the program. Two problems arose with this: originally it did not get the distance from
                    the centre of the pieces but rather the top right corner. This would cause issues where if you clicked a piece on its right 
                    side, you would pick up the piece to the right of the one you thought you would pick up. Additionally, the code
                    did not know what do to if you clicked an empty space as it assumed something had to be there resulting in a crash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During development, it was paramount that I could switch between my coordinate notation for pieces and chess board square 
                    names. Co-ordinates are tuples with an X and Y value, both starting at 0 and maxing out at 7, meanwhile, square names are two 
                    character strings with a letter (A through H) and a number (1 through 8). I created two sister functions which work as the 
                    inverse of each other. The test table below shows the code converting from square names to co-ordinates

                    Notice, I expected a failure for certain parameters, yet in two cases it succeeded regardless. In theory, anything out of 
                    bounds should evoke an error, in reality, an error is only caused if the letter part is unrecognized. The function
                    will take any number for the second half and apply the same mathematics on top of it, but for the letter half the function 
                    references a list with 8 letters and retrieves the corresponding index. Because of this, the function will only fail if the 
                    letter is unknown.

                <p>
                    Overall I am satisfied with my project. Out of my original goals (specified in the Investigation and Plan section)
                    I was able to achieve many of them:
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>✅ A turn based system</li>
                        <li>✅ Enforcing correct movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>✅ Pawn promotion</li>
                        <li>✅ Automatic movement of pieces</li>
                        <li>✅ Game save states</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it was not listed, I had wanted to get a checkmate algorithm completed. This algorithm proved to have too
                    many edge cases to consider and was a nightmare to test properly, thus it did not make the cut. The solution I had
                    to this problem could not consider other pieces moving in front of the king to block checkmate, so I abandoned it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to improve the project, I would want to add a GUI for every function currently bound to the keyboard, 
                    add a save/load file dialog, add checkmate, export .chess files as .gif and possibly implement online play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I would be interested in creating a more advanced single player mode. The current implementation cuts
                    a lot of corners and is extremely easy to beat as it has no intelligence whatsoever. I could possibly hook 
                    the <a href="https://stockfishchess.org">Stockfish</a> engine into the game as a quick solution, but I would like
                    to make my basic engine. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "check_position" function of the chess piece class is in dire need of a rework. Its performance is dreadful
                    which is apparent when the game auto plays at full speed. The main bottleneck is this function, it has nested 
                    for loops consuming an egregious number of cpu cycles.
